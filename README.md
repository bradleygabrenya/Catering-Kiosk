# Catering-Kiosk
A program that accesses a CSV file to input a catering inventory into an interface that kept track of user balance, updated stock of items, and completed transactions.

This was a project for a coding bootcamp that helped me refine my skills with data access objects and the principles of object-oriented programming.
